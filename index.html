  Hello! I'm a soon-to-be Instructor in the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/mcp.html">Department of Molecular & Cellular Physiology</a> at Stanford University, working in the lab of <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab">Brian Kobilka</a> (who was also my postdoctoral mentor). I'm interested in using biochemical and biophysical methods to study how membrane proteins are trafficked and regulated in cells.
 
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Harvard University, where I studied the essential human enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). I was joint advised by <a href="https://walkerlab.hms.harvard.edu/">Prof. Suzanne Walker</a>, and <a href="https://kahnelab.chemistry.harvard.edu//">Prof. Daniel Kahne</a>. 
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
  Prior to that, I obtained an honours BSc from the University of Toronto in the Specialist program in Synthetic and Catalytic Chemistry. I conducted undergraduate research in organic synthesis with <a href="https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/bateylab/">Prof. Robert A. Batey</a> and organometallics with <a href="https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/staff/DSONG/home.html">Prof. Datong Song</a>.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
Outside the lab I can usually be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejohnnler/">riding my bike </a> all over beautiful California.
