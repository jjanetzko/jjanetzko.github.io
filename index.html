  Hello! I'm a soon-to-be Instructor in the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/mcp.html">Department of Molecular & Cellular Physiology</a> at Stanford University in the lab of <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab">Brian Kobilka</a> (who was also my postdoctoral mentor). I'm interested in using biochemical and biophysical methods to study how membrane proteins are trafficked and regulated in cells.
 
  <br />
  <br />
  
  I did my PhD in Chemistry at Harvard, where I studied the essential human enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). I was joint advised by <a href="https://walkerlab.hms.harvard.edu/">Suzanne Walker</a>, and <a href="https://kahnelab.chemistry.harvard.edu//">Dan Kahne</a>. 
   
  <br />
  <br />
  
  Before that, I studied synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry at the University of Toronto.
 
 <br />
 <br />
  
Outside the lab I can usually be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thejohnnler/">riding my bike </a> all over beautiful California.
