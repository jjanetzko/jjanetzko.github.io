  I'm currently a basic science instructor in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/mcp.html">the Department of Molecular & Cellular Physiology</a> at Stanford University. I work in the lab of <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/kobilkalab">Prof. Brian Kobilka</a> where I use biochemical and biophysical methods to study how G protein-coupled receptors are regulated in cells. I first joined Prof. Kobilka's lab as a postdoctoral scholar in September 2017; my research has been supported by a Stanford School of Medicine Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship, a <a href="https://www.damonrunyon.org/">Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship</a> and, most recently, a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award from the <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/">National Institute of General Medical Sciences</a>. As a K99 fellow I am co-mentored by <a href="http://www.vzlab.org/">Prof. Mark von Zastrow</a> (UCSF), an expert in GPCR cell biology and trafficking. In December 2022 I was appointed as an instructor in Molecular & Cellular Physiology.

  Prior to coming to Stanford I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry from Harvard University. As a graduate student I was jointly advised by <a href="https://walkerlab.hms.harvard.edu/">Prof. Suzanne Walker</a> and <a href="https://kahnelab.chemistry.harvard.edu//">Prof. Daniel Kahne</a>. My graduate research focussed on the essential human enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Specifically, my dissertation, titled: <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2451139816?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true">OGT Catalyzes Three Distinct Post-translational Modifications via Glycosylation</a> centered around structure-function studies of OGT. However, I was also involved in several projects developing small molecule probes, both for OGT and for the bacterial protease ClpP.

  I obtained an honours BSc from the University of Toronto in the specialist program in synthetic and catalytic chemistry. I conducted undergraduate research in organic synthesis with <a href="https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/bateylab/">Prof. Robert A. Batey</a> and organometallics with <a href="https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/chemistry/staff/DSONG/home.html">Prof. Datong Song</a>.

Outside the lab, I am deeply involved with the local cycling community. I am an active racer on the <a href="https://ncnca.org/">Northern California/Nevada Cycling scene</a> where I race for <a href="https://www.altovelo.org/">Alto Velo</a>. Outside of my own racing, I am passionate about rider education and development. I have been a coach for the <a href="https://cycling.stanford.edu/">Stanford University cycling team</a> since 2020 and was elected to serve on the Alto Velo Board of Directors in 2022 (and recently re-elected for 2023).
