<p> So, I'm looking to try out something new. I've found myself getting wrapped up in some of the discussions on Science Twitter and I realize that there are many issues facing us as the next generation of faculty members. We face many issues surrounding diversity, equity, funding, and labor. Starting in 2023 I'd like to see if I can at least make monthly posts on topics that may be of interest to trainees and academics. Stay tuned! </p>
