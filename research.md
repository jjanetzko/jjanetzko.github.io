## How are GPCRs engaged by &#946;-arrestins?

<p>
To achieve temporal regulation of signaling, a family of proteins known as &#946;-arrestins are responsible for terminating G protein-mediated signaling and desensitizing receptors. &#946;-arrestin proteins are also responsible for mediating the internalization of most GPCRs and dictating their recycling and re-sensitization behavior. The longstanding view of how GPCRs are recognized by &#946;-arrestins is that recruitment is mediated by 1. protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between key loops in arrestin and the transmembrane (TM) bundle of the GPCR, and 2. post-translational modification (PTM)-mediated interactions between the N-terminal domain of arrestin and phosphorylated motifs within the GPCR (e.g., GPCR C-terminus).

At the outset of my postdoctoral work a recently solved structure of rhodopsin-arrestin 1 was available, but there were no structures of any GPCR-&#946;-arrestin complexes. While the vertebrate visual system is comprised of two GPCRs and two dedicated arrestin proteins, in all other cell-types the remaining hundreds of GPCRs are regulated by just two &#946;arrs. This raises interesting questions about the nature of molecular recognition between &#946;arrs and diverse GPCRs and suggested that these complexes may differ from that seen for rhodopsin. Together with two other postdoctoral fellows in the Kobilka lab and one postdoctoral fellow in the Skiniotis lab (Stanford) we succeeded in obtaining a long-sought structure of a GPCR bound to a &#946;-arrestin using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). <img src="https://jjanetzko.github.io/images/overall_EM_figure-01.png" style="float:right;width:300px;"> We used the neurotensin type 1 receptor (NTSR1) as it forms a particularly stable interaction with &#946;arrs. In addition to the expected PPIs between key &#946;arr1 loops and the TM core, and protein-phosphate interactions between the NTSR1 C-terminus and the N-terminal domain of &#946;arr1, we also found a bound signaling lipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (henceforth PIP<sub>2</sub>) at the interface of NTSR1 and &#946;arr1. This was the first picture of how membrane PIPs could act to stabilize the complex and maintain the core-engaged state known to be important for GPCR desensitization. Our structure, refined to a nominal global resolution of 4.2 &#8491;, showed considerable conformational heterogeneity. In particular, the use of multibody refinement (prior to the availability of 3D VA) showed that within the sample the relative orientation between NTSR1 and &#946;arr1 could vary dramatically. We reason that this flexibility may allow for recognition of diverse GPCRs, phosphorylation differences, the influence of different membrane PIPs, or interactions with other proteins present in clathrin-coated structures (CCSs), where most GPCRs traffic during CME. However, this structure, together with those that have followed it, while important for understanding how GPCRs are regulated by &#946;arrs, cannot alone address questions surrounding how these complexes assemble, disassemble, or interact with downstream signaling effectors.

## Studies of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)

<p>
As a graduate student I studied the essential human enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). There were two major goals for my OGT work, the first of which was to continue ongoing work in the Walker lab to develop cell-permeable inhibitors of OGT which would allow for interrogation of its biological function in cells, and the second was to understand mechanistic details of catalysis by OGT. Together with others in the Walker lab, we succeeded in developing high-affinity OGT inhibitors using structure-based design together with an extensive medicinal chemistry campaign that improved on a molecular scaffold first identified in a high-throughput screen (Ortiz-Meoz et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2018). Most of my Ph.D., however, focused on answering an important mechanistic question which emerged in 2012: how is a sugar-transferase able to catalyze amide bond cleavage? This enzyme, known for many years to transfer a single sugar molecule to serine/threonine (S/T) residues in hundreds of intracellular proteins, was identified as the long missing protease responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the transcriptional co-activator protein host cell factor-1 (HCF-1). We wanted to know how OGT engaged HCF-1 as a substrate, and whether OGT was the protease directly responsible for amide bond cleavage. We showed that the critical glutamate residue at the scissile bond is positioned in the OGT active site similarly to a glycosylation substrate, and that mutation to serine resulted in glycosylation, rather than proteolysis. We also showed that HCF-1 cleavage required OGTâ€™s glycosyltransferase activity, unequivocally demonstrating that OGT was the protease for HCF-1. Structures of OGT bound to an HCF-1 substrate peptide revealed how a threonine-rich region of the HCF-1 substrate peptide bound within the lumen of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of OGT, a binding mode likely employed by other OGT substrates (Lazarus et al. 2013). I went on to show that proteolysis proceeds by formation of a glycosyl glutamate intermediate and that this species leads to amide bond cleavage via an internal pyroglutamate. This was the first example of OGT modifying a residue other than S/T (Janetzko et al. 2016). In subsequent work I showed that aspartic acid can also be modified; however, the resulting glycosyl aspartate reacts further ultimately leading to a net isomerization to isoaspartate (Janetzko et al. 2017). These studies not only raised the possibility that OGT may modify cellular proteins on residues beyond serine and threonine, but also offered a clue as to the inherent reactivity of these carboxyl esters in the context of polypeptides. Aspartate-to-isoaspartate interconversion has been implicated in protein aging, but prior to this work was thought to occur only as a spontaneous process. These results suggest that other enzymes, such as ADP-ribosyltransferases, may generate these species within cells.
