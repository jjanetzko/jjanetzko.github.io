## How a GPCR is engaged by a \u03B2-arrestin

To achieve temporal regulation of signaling, a family of proteins known as \u03B2-arrestins are responsible for terminating G protein-mediated signaling and desensitizing receptors. \u03B2-arrestin proteins are also responsible for mediating the internalization of most GPCRs and dictating their recycling and re-sensitization behavior. The longstanding view of how GPCRs are recognized by arrestins is that recruitment is mediated by 1. protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between key loops in arrestin and the transmembrane (TM) bundle of the GPCR, and 2. post-translational modification (PTM)-mediated interactions between the N-terminal domain of arrestin and phosphorylated motifs within the GPCR (e.g., C-terminus). At the outset of my postdoctoral work a recently solved structure of rhodopsin-arrestin 1 was available8, but there were no structures of GPCR-\u03B2-arrestin complexes. While the vertebrate visual system has two GPCRs and two dedicated arrestin proteins, in all other cell-types the remaining hundreds of GPCRs are regulated by only two \u03B2arrs. This raised interesting questions about the nature of molecular recognition between \u03B2arrs and diverse GPCRs and suggested that these complexes may differ from what was seen for rhodopsin. Together with two other postdoctoral fellows in the Kobilka lab and one postdoctoral fellow in the Skiniotis lab (Stanford) we succeeded in obtaining a long-sought structure of a GPCR bound to a \u03B2-arrestin using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We used the neurotensin type 1 receptor (NTSR1) as a model, as it forms a particularly stable interaction with \u03B2arrs. In addition to the expected PPIs between key \u03B2arr1 loops and the TM core, and protein-phosphate interactions between the NTSR1 C-terminus and the N-terminal domain of \u03B2arr1, we also found a bound signaling lipid, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (henceforth PIP2) at the interface of NTSR1 and \u03B2arr1. This was the first picture of how membrane PIPs can act to stabilize the complex and maintain the core-engaged state known to be important for GPCR desensitization. Our structure, refined to a nominal global resolution of 4.2 \212B, showed considerable conformational heterogeneity. In particular, the use of multibody refinement (prior to the availability of 3D VA) showed that within the sample the relative orientation between NTSR1 and \u03B2arr1 could vary dramatically. We reason that this flexibility may allow for recognition of diverse GPCRs, phosphorylation differences, the influence of different membrane PIPs, or interactions with other proteins present in clathrin-coated structures (CCSs), where most GPCRs traffic during CME. However, this structure, together with those that have followed it, while important for understanding how GPCRs are regulated by \u03B2arrs, cannot alone address questions surrounding how these complexes assemble, disassemble, or interact with downstream signaling effectors.
